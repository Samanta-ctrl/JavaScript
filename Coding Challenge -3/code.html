        <h1>JavaScript Coding Challenge -3</h1>
        
        <p>John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.</p>
        <p>To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created a simple tip calculator(as a function). He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is b/w $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.</p>
        <p>In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:</p>
        <p>1. Containing all three tips(one for each bill)</p>
        <p>2. Containing all three final paid amounts(bill + tip)</p>
        <br>
        <p style="color: blue"><span style="color: red;text-decoration: underline">NOTE:- </span> To calculate 20% of a value , simply multiply if with 20/100 = 0.2</p>
