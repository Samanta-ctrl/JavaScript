        <h1>JavaScript Coding Challenge -5</h1>
        
        <p>Remember the tip calculator challenge? Let's create a more advanced version using everything we learned!</p>
        <p>This time, John and his family went to 5 diff. restaurants. The bills were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42.</p>
        <p>John likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is b/w $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.</p>
        <p>Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:</p>
        <p>1. Create an object with an array for the bill values.</p>
        <p>2. Add a method to calculate the tip.</p>
        <p>3. This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills and do the tip calculations.</p>
        <p>4. As an output, create 1) a new array containing all tips, and 2) an array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip).</p>
        <p style="color: blue"><span style="color: red">HINT:- </span>Start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them up in the loop.</p>
        <br>
        <p>EXTRA AFTER FINISHING: Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 4 diff. restaurants. The bills were $77, $375, $110, and $45.</p>
        <p>Mark likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10% when the bill is b/w $100 and $300, and 25% if the bill is more than $300 (different than John).</p>
        <p>5. Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's tipping rules.</p>
        <p>6. Create a funtion (not a method) to calculate the average of a given array of tips.</p>
        <p style="color: blue"><span style="color: red">HINT:-</span>Loop over the array, and in each iteration store the current sum in a variable (starting from 0). After you have the sum of the array, divide it by the number of elements in it (that's how you calculate the average).</p>
        <p>7. Calculate the avg tip for each family</p>
        <p>8. Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average.</p>
