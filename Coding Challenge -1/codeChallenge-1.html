        <h1>JavaScript Coding Challenge : 1</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 20px; color: mediumvioletred">Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI(Body Mass Index), which is calculated by the formula : BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height * height). (where mass in kg and height in meter)</p>
        <p>1. Store Mark's and john's height in variables</p>
        <p>2. Calculate both their BMIs.</p>
        <p>3. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.</p>
        <p>4. print a string to the console containing the variable from step 3. (Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true").</p>
